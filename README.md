This project investigates the design and analysis of a quarter-car model incorporating a vibration absorber to evaluate its performance in real-world vehicle suspension systems. The study extends beyond theoretical modeling to include a review of practical applications. Integrating insights from existing literature, it underscores the effectiveness of vibration absorbers in improving ride comfort, road-holding capability, and safety under various driving conditions.
